# GameJam_acm_2017
12 hour game jam for CSUS ACM using 2 themes: web api and pinatas. 
This project uses Node.js with Socket.io for the api, React.js for the front end controller, and Unity c# for the game. Inspiration for this project is directly from [Jacks Party Pack](https://jackboxgames.com/); I imagine their architecture is similar.
